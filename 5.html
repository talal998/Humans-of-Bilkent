                    <p class="subhead">"My life in Bilkent has been a rollercoaster ride, full of ups and downs, highs and lows, and it feels like I’ve seen most out of what this university has to offer. I enrolled in Bilkent as an MBG student, but within my very first year, I realized that this highly specific academic field that required hours of research and effort in labs was not for me. I wanted to study something that involved social interaction so I took a bold decision of changing my department to International Relations. <br><br>
                        In my point of view, IR students are more aware of the politics and international affairs and are more open to engaging in constructive arguments about random issues than students from MBG who are more focused on academics and research. I know they are two different dimensions but I'm happy I experienced the best of both. Of course, I only spent one year in the MBG department, so my opinion might sound cliched. Nevertheless, I’m glad that I switched my department. <br><br>
                        
                        Before coming to Bilkent, I was an exchange student in Germany and I met various people from around the world. I used to party often then, so I had the chance of seeing people genuinely enjoy their time at these events. But I feel people miss that here, they take everything as if it's a duty or a responsibility. Even at Mayfest, you would see people attending this event not because they want to but as a self-imposed obligation. Also, most students of Bilkent are reserved and prefer to remain in the same group throughout their university life. I just hope that we could break this monotonous cycle and genuinely enjoy college while it lasts!" <br><br>
