                    <p class="subhead">"I didn't know what to expect before leaving Belgium and coming to Turkey, which I think you would understand since it was a completely foreign place. However, only after 3 days here, I began to realize that a semester is not going to be enough in this magnificent country. <br><br>

                        I'm amazed at how much I have been able to explore during my time here. I often find myself sitting at a table with more than 8 different nationalities juggling between the four different languages I am familiar with. At the end of the day, I’m sometimes confused about what language to think in; It’s an amazing experience!<br><br>
                        
                        There's something I need to mark off my bucket list though: visiting the eastern part of Turkey to explore the centuries-old heritage and customs that represent the true origins of Turkey and its cultural diversity.<br><br>
                        
                        I haven't had the opportunity yet but I hope to have time to walk through the alleys of Ankara and exchange a few words with the city's elders. So I can try and see Turkey from their perspective. I am currently taking two courses that are entirely taught in Turkish so I don't think this day is too far out!"  <br><br>
