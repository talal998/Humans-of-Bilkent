                    <p class="subhead">“Before coming to Ankara I dreamt of double majoring in Computer Engineering with Economics. For me, life was sunshine and rainbows when I came to Bilkent. I didn’t realize that there was a calculus course which would be the breaking point for me. It wasn’t that I didn’t get the subject matter, but that it was so bland that It made me realize that I was going to encounter similar subjects if I was to remain in this department and how irrelevant these subjects were with what I want to pursue in my life.This, together with my strong interest in Computer Science and Economics, made me consider switching from CS to CTIS, that I never considered being an option before but after thorough research seemed a perfect match for me. I admit that my liking towards CTIS over CS might be subjective as it is more of what I desire to do. <br><br>
                        Enjoying every class in Bilkent is rare right? In CTIS, I am the guy who loves going to my classes.<br><br>
                        
                        For me, the first year in this department was all about the grades as I was trying to prove a point to myself. I got the highest possible GPA for two consecutive semesters and spent the entire summer practicing coding. <br><br>
                        
                        However, last summer I went to Singapore for my internship and began to notice that the world does not work on letter grades. I realized this when I was around people with PHDs from Harvard and MIT who never showed any signs that they felt I was any lesser than them. They valued me on my skills and the work I produced instead of the As and Bs that I had in my transcript. <br><br>
                        I think this is how the real world works. The skills you acquire during your university life would always be valued above your academic credentials and would help you succeed in your professional life no matter what subject you majored in.” <br><br>
