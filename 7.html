                    <p class="subhead">"Imagine being the only student from your country in Bilkent. You are excited at first because you have a chance to start over. You make some new friends that all happen to be other internationals, the majority being from engineering departments. Your first year goes by, and even though you miss your Japanese friends, life is good. <br><br>
                        Then you see your friends get busy in their own lives because academics in Bilkent is no joke and your parents move back to Japan, leaving you alone in this place. This is when you have the epiphany that you are stranded in a foreign land, for God knows how long, with a culture and language that is completely oblivious to you. You agree with the terms that life has put you on and try your best to socialize and travel in an attempt to find how you fit in in this new place. However, a couple of setbacks bring you back to square one and you are left lying on your bed watching Netflix, wondering what else can you do to adapt to your new surroundings. This is what life in Bilkent has been for me so far. <br><br>
                        
                        From an extroverted person in Japan to an introvert in Bilkent, from a highly ambitious student to someone who has lost his passion in life, from partying with friends to drinking alone, I was constantly trying to find a balance between the two extremes of lives I was in. <br><br>
                        
                        Honestly, as time passed by, I became tired of trying. Wouldn't you have? I stopped going to the classes, I guess I didn't have alot to look forward to. I started to regret my decision of moving to Turkey. Well, university life is no bed of roses. It's a brutal battle to maintain a balance between your social and academic lives, and a struggle to literally prevent tears from rolling down your cheeks. <br><br>
                        
                        I'm almost constantly struggling with the feeling that I'm not putting my talents and time into good use.
                        I've faced many hardships 
                        during my time in Bilkent but I've also met some amazing people who still make me want to stay here. Bilkent does not have what I want to study so I'm leaving soon but over the course of two years, I've made many memories that I would cherish for times to come even back in Japan.<span id="firstLetter">"</span> <br><br>
