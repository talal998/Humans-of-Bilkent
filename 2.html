                    <p class="subhead">“People are reserved around Bilkent, aren't they? This indifferent attitude in Bilkent's community became more apparent to me during my summer in Ohio, US. I worked at a winery, and a significant part of my day revolved around meeting people from various backgrounds. A common characteristic amongst most of these people was their ability to open up to a stranger. They share and encourage you to share. I felt that approaching a stranger and opening up a little was just a regular part of their day. <br><br>
                        During my stay in the US, I gradually realized how talking to and smiling at strangers might seem trivial yet make a huge difference in establishing a community without social awkwardness. That's the most important lesson that I brought back with me.  <br><br>
                        I was not the type of person who used to randomly talk with others. I guess I smile more often now or say 'hi' to a familiar stranger because that's the least I can to do to make a difference. Just today, I saw a girl standing in front of a mirror and realized that we've been living in the same dorm for about a year now and have never talked. I confronted her with some small talk. Things felt strange for a couple of seconds at first; however, at least we are now not completely oblivious to each other. I think it makes me feel better and might even help others build up their confidence.  <br><br>
                        I would love to live on a campus where smiling at strangers is not a burden. A place where people are more engaged with one another and a community where people can open up to strangers. Wouldn't it help reduce the stress that people experience at this university?  <br><br>
                        My advice to the people around here is, always be open to sharing something. It doesn't have to be personal!” <br><br> <span id="hobIg" onclick="window.open('https://www.instagram.com/humansofbilkent')" style="cursor: pointer;">#humansofbilkent</span> </p>
