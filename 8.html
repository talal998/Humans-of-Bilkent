                    <p class="subhead">During my first four semesters in Bilkent, I was exploring opportunities by going on trips, attending club meetings and interacting with diverse people. I was extremely outgoing and academics was not my primary focus at that time.<br><br> 

                        Needless to say, I did make a plethora of friends and got executive positions in some clubs. However, it all came down at the expense of compromising some courses and I have been taking seven courses for the past two semesters.<br><br> 
                        
                        What do I regret about my time here? Well Honestly, I don’t regret anything. I like to think that the more pressure that I take the more I perform. I like to push my limits and I think that is how I grow most as a person.<br><br> 
                        
                        There were times of self-doubt when I wondered whether or not I’m in the right program or am I doing the right thing. However, I kept assuring my self that life is not always going to be like this, once I push through the hard part, I’m going to enjoy myself. <br><br> 
                        
                        Pulling off the Bilkent International Festival was one of the biggest highlights of my time in Bilkent. I was worried till the last moment since there were so many things happening at the same time, there was so much to coordinate, and the expectations were high, but it all came together at the end because of the immense hard work that I and my peers put in.<br><br> 
                        
                        If I hadn’t joined all the clubs that I’m part of and not met people I now know, I would have the same limited scope of interest that I had before coming to the university. To be honest, Bilkent is not the easiest place to socialize but if I am honest, some people don’t put in enough effort; they never go on trips or talk to new people. It's about getting out of your comfort zone, and trust me I know all the anxiety that a person faces by being in such situations but we only grow and explore by being a little uncomfortable.<br><br> 
                        
                        On an ending note, I would like to thank all the peers and professors who helped me through this journey in Bilkent. I will always remember you guys. <br><br>   <span id="hobIg" onclick="window.open('https://www.instagram.com/humansofbilkent')" style="cursor: pointer;">#humansofbilkent</span> </p>
