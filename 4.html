                    <p class="subhead">“They were saved off the street and honestly, I feel that they’re like my children. Each one of them holds a special place in my heart and makes life a bit more colorful. They understand me so well, whenever I’m depressed or upset, Değerli tries to console me in his way by licking my face. Whenever I’m sick, all of them stay with me in my bed to give me company. <br><br>
                        I don’t have any favorites, each of them is unique is so is their story; I love them all equally. Papatya is the most docile one. She walks with me every day and always finds her way towards me. She gets sad when I’m leaving home. So, does each of the rest. <br><br>
                        Loui was ill when he was a puppy. I was there for him then; we formed a special bond, and it’s still strong, since then he’s been there for me whenever things get tough. <br><br>
                        Değerli loves being around people, he’s very playful. However, he has a strong sense of foresight. Whenever he sees someone with bad intentions approaching me, he warns me by barking at them. There have been times when he has figured out that a person would be bad for me in the long run, before I did! <br><br>
                        I don't often bring them to Bilkent. Just today, when I went to take two lectures, they kept on barking until I was back, for two straight hours! But I guess this just depicts how much they love me. <br><br>
                        Save a stray dogs off the street, you never know how much color they will bring to your life!”.<br><br>
